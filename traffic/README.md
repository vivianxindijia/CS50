The goal of the first part of this projecy - load data function, is to load all of the images in these 43 folders. Read them, standardise them with width and height, and put them in list.So what we need to do is converting the sting gtsrb into a actual path of our folder. After that, we need to check whether this folder exists, by chekcing 1 file each time, by creating a loop. Then we are going to read the image. Once we read the images, we need to resize it - same width, height, and then add the final version to the list. We also need to append the label to put them into the correct category. When we finish, we can return to the images and labels. Next, I created a neural network for 43 categories as outputs. We are going to fill in the image, and do the model, and output which type of traffic sign it is.

It turned out that it didn't work too well. The accuracy is a bit low and bad. The bad thing is that we canâ€™t really see the iamge, we just need to assume that they are doing it in the right way. However, there are some things worked well as well - we can see the accuracy changing, by adding filters, edit maxpooling, using different dense, or changing the text size etc. We just need to play it aroung and improve the accuracy of this project.
